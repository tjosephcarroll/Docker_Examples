These Dockerfiles demonstrate the impact on build time that many layers add to your Image build. Additionally, every added layer represents more metadata. Unnecessary layers should be avoided at all costs.

To test.

    $ cd many
    $ time docker build . --no-cache
    ...
    ...
    real	0m3.499s
    user	0m0.088s
    sys	0m0.048s
    $ cd ../few
    $ time docker build . --no-cache
    ...
    ...
    real	0m0.631s
    user	0m0.083s
    sys	0m0.040s

The these dockerfiles are functionally equivalent, but one builds many times faster than the other.
